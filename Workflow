Data Analysis Workflow:  

1. Objectives 

Research Question: How does proximity to major airports affect air quality over time? (or: How does proximity to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport affect air quality over time?) 

Key Hypotheses:  

Proximity to major airports significantly increases air pollution levels (e.g. <20 km and >30 km as control). 

Emission reduction measures have improved air quality (AQI) near airports over time. 

 

2. Data Collection & Preparation 

Source: EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS) database & 2023 Air Traffic Report (ATR) for airport selection. 

Scope:  

Download daily pollutant data (PM2.5, NOx, CO, and others) from 1999–2024. 

Focus on monitors within varying distances of the airport (using Niall’s data fetching code).   

Derive Metrics:  

Calculate daily AQI for each pollutant using EPA’s method

3. Visualisation 

Time Series Plots:  

Display AQI and pollutant concentration trends over time. 

Zone Comparisons:  

Visualize pollutant levels across defined proximity zones (e.g., box plots). 

Spatial Processing:  

Match air quality monitoring stations to airports using geospatial analysis (as in workshop 3) to generate an interactive map for better visualization.  

 

4. Analysis 

à Correlation and Proximity Analysis 

Test the relationship between proximity and air quality metrics:  

Statistical Techniques: Pearson/Spearman correlation, scatterplots. 

Compare AQI across zones (e.g., <10 km vs. >20 km). 

à Hypothesis Testing 

Hypothesis 1: Does proximity negatively impact air quality?  

Test: T-test to compare pollutant levels across proximity zones. (Define two groups of proximity, ‘near’ and ‘far’)  

H0: The mean air quality is the same for both groups 

H1: The mean air quality is different for the two groups 

Outcome: Establish whether pollutant levels are significantly higher near airports. 

Hypothesis 2: Do emission reduction policies reduce pollutants over time?  

Test: Paired t-test or regression discontinuity analysis. 

Outcome: Assess policy effectiveness. 

  

à Temporal Analysis: Use time series analysis to Identify trends in pollutant levels over time. 

 

** Predictive Modeling ** (only if we have time) 

Build a regression model to predict AQI based on proximity, airport activity, and emission policies.  

Features: Proximity zones, passenger traffic, time, and policy indicators. 

Model Types: Random Forest on lecture 10 for example?
